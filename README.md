# Stack Docs

This is the source for the [Stack Docs](https://docs.stack.jimmycai.com/) website.

## Development

Installing dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Running the development server:

```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

> Note: for some unknown reason, during development, modifying the config file, `docs/.vuepress/config.ts`, does not reflect the change in real time. It's necessary to restart the server.

## Build

Building the website:

```bash
npm run docs:build
```
